# TEAMPROJ-JS-pizza-order-admin
Three-persons-project. Pizza ordering website with admin and order listing site incl. own backend. The orders are stored in separated JSON files (backend/data/orders) identified with auto-generated ids.
/admin: http://localhost:2000/admin
Here you can add new and delete or modify existing pizzas. "Active: false" means the pizza is inactive so it will disappear on the public index.html.
/order: http://localhost:2000/order
This site "made for kitchen" with minimal design. It gives an overview of the current orders. You can change the status of orders and filter what is still open.

Start:
cd backend - node server
